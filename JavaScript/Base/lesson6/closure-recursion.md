## 4 task

#### Closure

Example:

```

var makeFunction = function () {
    var addOne = function (x) {
        return x + 1;
    };
    return addOne; // return the function
};
// makeFunction is a function with no arguments

var f = makeFunction();
// f is a function that takes one argument

var y = f(3);
// now y is 4
```
